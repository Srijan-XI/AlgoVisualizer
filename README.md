# AlgoVisualizer

Welcome to AlgoVisualizer, an interactive program designed to help users understand sorting algorithms through entertaining animations.

## Introduction

AlgoVisualizer is a Java-based interactive tool that visualizes various sorting algorithms, providing users with a hands-on way to learn and explore how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and others work in real-time. Whether you're new to programming or a seasoned developer, AlgoVisualizer offers an intuitive graphical interface to observe and understand sorting processes step-by-step.

## Features

- **Interactive Animations:** Watch sorting algorithms come to life with engaging visualizations.
  
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Choose from a variety of algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Experience sorting algorithms in action, with each step animated on the graphical display.

- **Adjustable Speed:** Control the speed of the animations to suit your learning pace.

## Getting Started
